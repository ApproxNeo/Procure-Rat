### Includes
A new psycast, "procure rat", that takes some time to charge up. Once done, a number of rats will join your colony, already tamed. Given that at least 2 rats join, at least 1 male and 1 female will join.

### Balance
Uhh idk... Free rats

### Customization
By default, 3 rats join every cast. This number can be changed by editing [Abilities.xml](1.3/Defs/Abilities.xml). The field to change is `numRat`

### Future
Yeah i dont know i just wanted to mod Rimworld
