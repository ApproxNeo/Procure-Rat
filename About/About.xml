Procure Rat is a Rimworld mod that adds some new psycasts dedicated to making you a God amonst men. (and also rats!)


Includes
A new psycast, "procure rat", that takes some time to charge up. Once done, a number of rats will join your colony, already tamed. Given that at least 2 rats join, at least 1 male and 1 female will join.
